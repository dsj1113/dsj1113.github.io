<p><span style="font-size:11px">Your 2019&ndash;2020 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was selected for review in a process called verification. The law says that before awarding Federal Student Aid, we may ask you to confirm the information you reported on your FAFSA. To verify that you provided correct information, we will compare your FAFSA with the information on this institutional verification document and with any other required documents. If there are differences, your FAFSA information may need to be corrected. You and a parent whose information was reported on the FAFSA must complete and sign this institutional verification document, attach any required documents, and submit the form and other required documents to us. We may ask for additional information. If you have questions about verification, contact us as soon as possible so that your financial aid award will not be delayed.</span></p>
